Test Accounts
-------------

Here is a list of account created for tests. I'm sure they violates Microsoft's TOS but I need some real meat to play with the API

Windows Live accounts:

  Mail / Login                | Password

  rwzwiybgu3hibsr@jetable.org | 4ddc9a0df
  sg6abk6c3yqprfj@jetable.org | 9850a6dbf
  jz08gxgvffqrtfk@jetable.org | 253bb129e

All these @jetable.org mails above are redirections to my true kevin@deldycke.com mail address. They'll expire in a month from now.
